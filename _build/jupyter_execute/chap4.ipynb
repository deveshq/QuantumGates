    "# Implementation of the CNOT-Gate\n",
    "Their are various possible techniques to convert Rydberg blockade operation into full C-NOT gate. We are going to discuss two different standard methods _H-CZ CNOT_ and _AS CNOT_ to implement the C-NOT quantum gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## H-CZ CNOT-Gate\n",
    "This technique make use of the fact that the C-NOT gate can be obtain from CZ-gate, by applying Hadamard gate before and after it. It can be easily shown using little linear algebra, which is given into Appendix-A. So before the implementation of the C-NOT gate, let's have a look how CZ-gate can be implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CZ-Gate Implementation\n",
    "Implementation of CZ involves standard three pulse sequence, shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3pulse](images/3pulse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in figure, the pulse 1 & 3 are $\\pi$ pulses and the pulse 2 is a $2\\pi$ pulse. A $2\\pi$ rotation corresponds to excitation and de-excitation of the target atom of an effective spin $1/2$. This rotation therefore imparts a $\\pi$ phase shift to the wave function of the target atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gate operation begins with the application of pulse 1 on control atom, which is tuned to $|1\\rangle \\to |r\\rangle$ transition. When the control atom is initially in state $|0\\rangle$, pulses 1 \\& 3 are detuned and have no effect. The pulse 2 applies a $\\pi$ phase shift on the target atom. When the control atom is initially in state $|1\\rangle$, from pulse 1, it get excited to Rydberg level. As a result, the $|r\\rangle$ level of nearby target atom shifts due to Rydberg blockade. This shifting of the $|r\\rangle$ level detunes the $2\\pi$ pulse and blocks the target excitation. Then the rotation does not occur and there is no phase shift of the target atom wave function. This results in a CZ controlled phase operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNOT-Gate Implementation\n",
    "As discussed earlier, CNOT-gate can be construct using CZ gate by applying H-gate ($\\pi/2$ pulse) before and after the CZ sequence. The standard five pulse sequence for the implementation of the H-CZ CNOT sequence is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![5pulse](images/5pulse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\pi/2$ pulse shown in figure (pulse 1), puts the atom into superposition of $|0\\rangle$ \\& $|1\\rangle$ i.e. $\\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Pulses 2, 3 and 4 performs a conditional phase gate on it, as in previous section. Depending upon state of control atom, if the phase of this state shift by $\\pi$, it becomes $\\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Then $\\pi/2$ pulse (pulse 5) transforms it to state $|1\\rangle$, collectively  applying an effective C-NOT on the target atom. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## AS C-NOT Gate\n",
    "An alternative approach to implement C-NOT gate, is to perform a controlled amplitude swap (AS-CNOT) on the target atom. Pulses 2-6 applied on target atom, swap the amplitudes of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "![7pulse](images/5pulse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in figure above, when the control atom is initially in the state $|1\\rangle$, pulses 1 \\& 7 are detuned and doesn't effect the atom. Meanwhile, pulses 2$-$ applies a not gate on the target atom. When the control atom is initially in state $|0\\rangle$, pulse 1 excites it to the Rydberg level $|r\\rangle$. Then the Rydberg blockade prevents pulses 2, 4 \\& 6 on the target atom from having any effect. The final pulse 7 returns the control atom to the ground state. This corresponds to a standard C-NOT operation, with some additional single qubit phase that can be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter with discussed about two pulse sequences for implementing the CNOT quantum gate. In the chapter, we'll see how to simulate them and their simulation result."
